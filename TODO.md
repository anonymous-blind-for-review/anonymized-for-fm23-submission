# Looking for ways to contribute?  

We aim to maintain some pointers here for ways people could contribute.  We assume that you are reasonably conversant with Agda, though you don't necessarily need to be super expert to contribute.  We recommend [this tutorial](https://plfa.github.io/) as a great place to start or build on your Agda journey.

Initially, we have sprinkled `TODO-n` comments throughout the repo, coded as follows, based on our assessment of the scope of the task.  

* `TODO-1`: Relatively easy (we think/hope) task that should be addressable locally, without propagating effects to other files.
* `TODO-2`: Somewhat more challenging, may propagate to a few other places, but relatively self-contained.
* `TODO-3`: Even more challenging, may require broader understanding of the overall repo and approach, and/or some more widespread changes.
* `TODO-4`: More substantial tasks at the level of the proof architecture, may require intimate knowledge of the overall approach and/or deeper Agda expertise.

You could contribute by:
* tackling a `TODO-n` task or an existing issue
* filing a new issue
* suggesting additional `TODO-n` tasks
* improving comments, organization, etc.

Our [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) provides details on how to contribute code.

If you would like guidance on where you might contribute, please consider filing an issue to introduce yourself, and let us know a bit about your background and describe how you envisage contributing.
